STOP!!!

Github issues is no place for general support. We encourage you to use our public support forum at https://spectrum.chat/react-table.

NOTE: If a support/help/question issue is opened, it will be closed immediately and be redirected to the forum. Thanks for helping us keep our issues clean and productive!

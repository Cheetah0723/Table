## News / Q&A

#### What is the current state of React Table?

React Table v7 is still under active development, and its API is still changing, albeit only slightly. For this reason, it is currently in an **beta** release state. It's estimated that it will be fully released as a stable version sometime during October 2019.

#### Should I use v7@beta in production?

You can use it in production as long as you lock in the beta version in your package.json and also accept that there may be unlikely, but possible bug fixes and/or API changes before it's official release.

#### I'm still using v6, what should I do?

v6 is a great library and is still the default install for `react-table`, however, I do not intend on offering any long-term support for it. If you intend to keep using v6, I recommend maintaining your own fork of the library and keeping it up to date for your version of React.

#### Where are the docs for the older v6 version?

Please [visit the v6 branch](https://github.com/tannerlinsley/react-table/tree/v6)

#### I want to migrate from v6 to v7. How do I do that?

The differences between the 2 versions are incredibly massive. Unfortunately, I cannot write a one-to-one upgrade guide for any of v6's API, simply because much of it is irrelevant with v7's headless approach. The best approach for migrating to v7 is to learn its API by reading the documentation and then following some of the examples to begin building your own table component.

In case you would need to have both v6 and v7 in one app during the migration process (large codebase, complex use cases), you can install an official [`react-table-v6` package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-table-v6) alongside the `react-table`.
